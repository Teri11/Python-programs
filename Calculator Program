1. Understanding the Problem
Before we start coding, let's define the problem. Our goal is to create a
calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
The program should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.

2. Building the Foundation
Let's start by setting up the basic structure of our program. We'll use
variables to store user input and results, and we'll incorporate input
functions to gather user choices.

python code
# Simple Calculator Program

# Function to perform addition
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
  
# Function to perform subtraction
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y
  
# Function to perform multiplication
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
  
# Function to perform division
def divide(x, y):
    if y != 0:
        return x / y
    else:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"

# Main function to run the calculator
def calculator():
    print("Calculator program")
    
# Get user input for numbers
num1 =float(input("Enter the first Number:"))
num2 =float(input("Enter the second Number:"))

# Get user input for operation
operation = input("Choose operation(+.-,*,/):")

# Perform the selected operation
if operation == "+":
    results =add(num1,num2)
    
elif operation == "-":
    results =subtract(num1,num2)
    
elif operation == "*":
    results =multiply(num1,num2)
    
elif operation == "/":
    results =divide(num1,num2)
    
else:
    results = "Invalid Operation"

    
# Display the result
print(f"Your answer = {results}")
# Run the calculator
calculator()
