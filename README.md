**Project Descriptions**
**Mad Libs Game**<br>
Create a simple Mad Libs game where the program asks the user for different types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) and then inserts those words into a pre-defined story template.<br>

**Simple Calculator**<br>
Build a basic calculator that takes user input for two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and then displays the result.<br>

**Tip Calculator**
Write a program that asks the user for the total bill amount and the percentage tip they would like to give, then calculates and displays the tip amount and total bill including the tip.

Unit Converter
Develop a unit converter that converts units such as kilometers to miles, pounds to kilograms, Celsius to Fahrenheit, etc., based on user input.

Guess the Number
Create a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number within a certain range and the user tries to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Password Validator
Make a program that asks the user for a password and then checks if the password meets certain criteria (e.g., length, contains uppercase and lowercase letters, includes numbers and special characters).

Basic Quiz
Design a simple quiz program that asks the user a series of questions and gives feedback based on their answers. At the end, it can provide a score.

Palindrome Checker
Write a program that checks if a given word or phrase (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case) is a palindrome.

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Implement the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The computer's choice can be randomized.

BMI Calculator
Create a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes the user's weight and height and calculates their BMI, then categorizes it (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).

Age Calculator
Develop a program that asks the user for their birth year and calculates their age.

Simple Text-Based Adventure Game
Write a text-based adventure game where the user makes choices to navigate through different scenarios and outcomes.

Shopping List
Create a program that allows the user to input items they need to buy and stores them in a list. The user can view, add, and remove items from the list.

Temperature Converter
Build a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin based on user input.

Currency Converter
Write a currency converter that takes an amount in one currency and converts it to another based on a given exchange rate.
